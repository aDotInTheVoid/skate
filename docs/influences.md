### Swift

TODO: Check out. It's an interesting look at a languge with rust like ADT's
but in a GC language

### RR/Pernesco

These are the state of the art in debuging, and I want it to feel as good as that.

I havn't tried pernesco though, it's too expesive, especialy for expirimentation.

Also I've only used rr/gdb with rust, so I should try it with c/c++ where it should
be less broken

## C#

Apparently has a reference/value dycotemy. TODO: Check out

## Elixir

`|>` Operator

## Scala

TODO: Check out. Toxic comunity though
