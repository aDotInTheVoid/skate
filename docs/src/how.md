# How

So how can we build such a thing.

## No Production

This is a **toy** language, that is ment for small personal use.
This is **not** ment for production use. This makes things much easier.

## No speed

Skateboards arn't fast, but CPU's are. We can afford to be incredably wastefull
as the language isn't ment for serious high performane things. If you're script
is going to run for longer than a few secounds, Skate isn't the right language.
Get one of the many bycicles.

## No stability

Because this will never be used in production, we can break things without worry.
This means a large standard library is much more viable, as we dont need to get
things right the first time, like go and rust do.

## No large platform support.

Windows/Linux/Mac on x64 only. Anything else can use a more serious language. 
As no large body of software should ever be written in Skate, no one should 
want it to run on HPPA or RiscV.
