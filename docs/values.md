# Values

Bryan Cantrill has a [great talk](https://youtu.be/2wZ1pCpJUIM) on software values. Lets go through all
the values listed, to talk about which ones we care about.

### Approachability

A skateboard is approachable. You can see someone on it an instantly know how it's used.
This doesn't mean you wont fall off the first time you try to ride.

### Availibilty

This is not for production. Skate code is not "fire and forget". You should always be watching,
to see if something's happeded. This massivly limits the areas you can skate, but if the ground
isn't flat, you wount go their

### Compatibily

This will break constantly. Not a value. Their should never be a specification for what is
means to skate.

### Composabilty

Yes, we want to be able to transition smothly from one trick to another.

### Expressivness

Yes, this is a creative endevor. You shoud be able to tell who wrote some skate by their style,
because this software doen't need to be maintained for decades to come, not every one needs to
do it the same

### Extensivness

Yes, we want users to do lisp-like macro things. Go Nuts. Their are no adults to stop you.

### Interoperability

No, this makes debuging a pain.

### Integrity

No, not for production.

### Maintanibility

No, this is for short, one of scripts

### Measurability

No, this should not be perfomance intensive

### Operability

No

### Performance

No

### Portability

No

### Resiliance

Yes, but with human assistance

### Rigor

Punt to a human on tricky cases. This may involve "Time Travel"

### Robustness

No

### Safety

NO

### Secutiry 


No

### Simplicity

No

### Stability

No

### Thoroghness

Yes, expecialy in the standard library

### Transparency

Yes, though the debuger

### Velocity

Yes, for developers
